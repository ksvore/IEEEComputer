% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

The coming quantum revolution will overturn our notions of computational methods and devices. Still in early stages of development, quantum computers use the quantum mechanical properties of superposition and entanglement to solve problems that are likely to be forever out of reach of classical computers.  Already we have a diverse range of quantum algorithms that outperform their classical counterparts, from cryptography to chemistry and materials science. Quantum computers will operate as co-processors, receiving instructions from a stack of classical processors to fault-tolerantly implement an algorithm.  A scalable software stack with high-level programming languages, optimizing compilers, simulators, emulators, and translation to hardware-level instructions will be crucial in the realization of algorithms in hardware.  
%As the landscape of quantum applications and devices rapidly evolves, we must be developing the tools necessary for scalability. 
Understanding the applications enabled by our quantum future, and how to harness them, will alter our economic, industrial, academic and societal landscape.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{M}{ore} than a century after the discovery of quantum mechanics we are on the threshold of an age of quantum technology in which quantum mechanics not only enables classical devices,  such as the transistor, but where quantum properties are essential to their operation. Unlike classical computers, quantum devices can simultaneously be in a ``superposition'' of many different states and have deep connections (``entanglement'') between spatially separated entities.  These properties make it possible to design devices whose capabilities exceed that of any imaginable classical computer.  In fact, devices to create quantum random numbers and securely encrypt communication are already commercially available. 

The arguably simplest device may be a {\em quantum random number generator} which uses the property of superposition:  a quantum bit (or qubit for short) can be created in a state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)$ that is the superposition  of the values 0 and 1 of a classical bit (see Box \ref{sec:box1}). Upon measuring the value of the qubit, the superposition collapses into one of the two classical states, and the measurement gives either the value 0 or 1, each with probability 1/2. This procedure realizes a true random number generator, which is impossible classically due to the deterministic nature of classical physics.\footnote{While chaotic classical processes might look random enough for many applications, only with quantum random numbers do we have the assurance of perfect randomness.}

Entangling two qubits $A$ and $B$ in a superposition denoted $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_A|0\rangle_B + |1\rangle_A|1\rangle_B)$, such that they are either {\em both} 0 or {\em both} 1, can be used for cryptography. Giving one of the qubits to Alice and one to Bob, the qubits can remain entangled no matter how far apart they are. Measuring their individual qubits, Alice and Bob will get a random result -- however both of them obtain the {\em same} random value. This can be used for {\em quantum teleportation} or to establish a shared secret key for  {\em provably secure  communication}, again surpassing classical technology. 
%\cite{RevModPhys.81.1301,EkertRenner2014}. 


Faced with the challenge of simulation of quantum systems on classical computers, Richard Feynman in 1982 \cite{Feynman1982} suggested to build computers that use quantum effects to compute, 
%use quantum devices to simulate physics problems. 
%Analog implementations of this idea in {\em quantum simulators }  
%%\cite{RevModPhys.86.153}  
%have  been successfully used to build tunable realizations of complex quantum models. Quantum simulators can also be used to solve purely classical problems. One example is a {\em quantum annealing} to solve hard optimization problems. However, quantum annealers have not yet shown any advantage over classical computers.
%% \cite{speedup}. 
%
%\section{Quantum computers and their applications}
%Richard Feynman's seminal paper already envisaged a digital quantum computer, overcoming calibration and design limitations of analog quantum devices by 
generalizing the bits and gates of classical computers to quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates. It turns out that such quantum computers have applications well beyond physics problems, and we already have a diverse range of quantum algorithms that outperform their classical counterparts (see Box \ref{sec:box2}).

Quantum computers are most readily known for solving integer factorization \cite{Shor1994}, where given an integer $N=p\times q$, the task is to determine the prime numbers $p$ and $q$.  This problem forms a mainstay of e-commerce today, as it underlies the most widely used public-key cryptosystem RSA.  A quantum computer consisting of roughly one billion physical qubits {\color{red}(see Rod Van Meter's article)} would be able to break a 2000-bit key RSA in a short time.  While quantum algorithms for cryptographic attacks are certainly an area of quantum advantage, their significance is sure to decrease over time.  Already, post-quantum cryptosystems are in development that aim for security against a quantum computer and companies and governments around the world are beginning to actively transition to such post-quantum cryptography methods.
%, as the changes will require years worth of software upgrades.  

More globally and economically impactful applications arise from the simulation of physical systems, which was the original motivation behind Feynman's seminal paper. Quantum computers will improve reliability of quantum chemical calculations by performing accurate simulations of molecules and materials on the scale of days to months for problems that might take billions of years on state-of-the-art supercomputers today. They can be applied to help solve critical real-world problems, such as elucidating the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation with application to fertilizer production or designing catalysts for carbon capture  capture and sequestration (to combat global warming).  Extensions of these approaches promise solutions for applications in materials modeling, including investigation of materials that display higher temperature superconductivity. 

The last decade has witnessed an explosion in classical machine learning methods for making predictions and gaining insights based on data.  Machine learning has utterly transformed domains such as speech recognition, computer vision, and web search.  With its foundations in computational statistics, machine learning is an area ripe for quantum improvements.  Recent results indicate that quantum algorithms may perform classification and clustering methods such as $k$-means and nearest-neighbor methods more efficiently than  classical methods.  Boltzmann machine training, deep learning, and neural networks have also been shown to have quantum advantages.  
%The discovery of quantum algorithms for machine learning is just beginning and
 %We anticipate a proliferation of methods as quantum hardware comes online.  

By and large, quantum algorithms presently require rigorous proofs to validate any improvements in runtime complexity over classical algorithms.  However,
% as seen by machine learning practitioners, 
often the best-performing algorithms on real-world data are heuristic in nature.  We may therefore look forward to having a modest-size quantum computer on which to test and master the art of quantum programming and quantum algorithm design.  The fruits of such labor will bear quantum algorithms for many real-world applications, as a generation of programmers look to quantum hardware for novel improvements in speed and accuracy.


\section{Quantum computers as special-purpose accelerators }


Quantum computers are unlike their classical cousins.  While in principle they can perform any computation that a classical computer can perform, we should not expect them to power future personal computers or phones. Classical computers will remain cheaper, smaller and more portable than quantum computers for many of these tasks. Quantum computers show their strength when running special quantum algorithms that solve certain computational tasks faster (in some cases exponentially faster) than any classical computer by acting on a superposition of values.  
%
%\begin{figure}[t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{figures/cryostat}
%\caption{The inside of a dilution refrigerator that is used to cool a quantum computer to milli-Kelvin temperatures. Various stages of the cryostat host the classical control logic and the quantum chips and operate at different temperatures. All are connected to a classical frontend (super)-computer that runs the classical parts of computations in a hybrid quantum-classical code and controls the quantum processor that acts as an accelerator.

%\label{fig:cryo}
%\end{figure}

A quantum computer will thus operate as a co-processor, receiving its instructions and cues from a stack of classical processors. To suppress noise and errors and keep the qubits in a superposition most designs for quantum computers require the qubits to be cooled to very low temperatures. This calls for the use of dilution refrigerators
%, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cryo}, 
and means that large-scale quantum computers will be operated in data centers and accessed remotely as a cloud service. Locally one may just have a limited number of qubits to establish secure communication or to use as secure ``quantum money''.

%\label{fig:femoco}
%\end{figure*}
%

Cryogenic temperatures alone are insufficient to keep qubits in superposition for the runtime of a non-trivial quantum algorithm and quantum error correction (QEC) 
%\cite{qec} 
is needed to extend the lifetime of quantum information.  QEC remarkably allows an arbitrarily large quantum computation to be performed efficiently as long as the rate of errors occurring on the physical qubits are below a given threshold value. The no-cloning theorem of quantum information, which makes quantum communication provably secure, unfortunately also makes QEC harder than classical fault tolerance. QEC can incur a large overhead and thousands or more ``physical'' qubits may be needed to realize a single error-protected ``logical'' qubit. 
%The classical processors must also continually monitor the ``logical" qubits and determine if they have been corrupted.  This is done by learning the location and type of errors in the system through measurement information obtained from the quantum computer.  The classical processors run a classical decoding algorithm, such as an approximation to maximum likelihood estimation or minimum weight perfect matching, to determine the most likely correction pattern that removes the errors on the qubits. 

Topological qubits,
 %\cite{tqc}
which  encode  quantum information in a non-local property of a quantum state, are a promising way of reducing the QEC overhead by being robust to any source of local noise.  While QEC works at the level of software, topological qubits have an intrinsic, hardware-level of protection that allows the qubits to achieve longer lifetimes and lower rates of errors.  With a lower rate of error the overhead of QEC may be dramatically reduced by several orders of magnitude.
% A topological quantum computer may use roughly a factor of 1000 fewer physical qubits to implement a given quantum algorithm than a superconducting qubit system or ion trap device.

Given the cost of quantum fault tolerance, qubits will be a rare commodity in quantum computers, leading to a radical shift in design from their classical counterparts where memory is cheap. Instead of moving data to computational units, early quantum computers will move operations to the data, applying gates directly to the memory qubits.  
In many electronic systems, the firmware that controls and manipulates the computer or device is rarely updated.  However, in a quantum computer, the firmware is inherently being optimized and updated continually during computation to reconfigure the device for the next steps.

 An even bigger difference exists in the design of quantum algorithms themselves. To make use of the  exponential parallelism inherent in a quantum superposition, computations need to be reversible, SIMD-like and follow certain design patterns that are discussed in Box \ref{sec:box3}.   %Most notably, readout is severely limited in a quantum computer. While an $N$-qubit quantum computer can act on a superposition of $O(2^N)$ values, only $N$ bits of information can be read out, requiring reduction operations to compute the relevant results.
% Quantum algorithms are also inherently probabilistic and must be designed so as to produce the correct answer with high probability.  A quantum algorithm can then be run several times to improve the probability of success. 
 
 
 



\section{Native applications: quantum chemistry and materials science}

Simulating quantum models can be considered the native application of quantum computers. How better to understand a quantum mechanical system than with a device that is inherently quantum mechanical! %The simulation of such models includes areas such as quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics. In quantum simulation, 
%The goal is to understand properties of a system, such as its energy, electron density, or excitation spectrum through simulation of their evolution according to Schr\"odinger's equation.  

The first applications of small quantum computers will be to simple quantum models whose exact dynamics is already intractable for classical computers for about one hundred lattice sites or orbitals.  Accurate solutions of such model systems can be used to develop and validate new classical simulation methods which can then, in turn, simulate more complex systems than are tractable by a small quantum computer. 

Recent algorithmic advances have substantially improved the scaling of algorithms for molecules or complex materials. A concrete example that has been worked out in detail  \cite{nitrogenase} is how to use quantum computers to understand biological nitrogen fixation. 
%Following Ref. \cite{nitrogenase} we illustrate how quantum computers will be used for such problems by considering simulations of the active center of the enzyme nitrogenase. 
The iron molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) of the enzyme nitrogenase can split a dinitrogen molecule, forming two ammonia molecules under ambient conditions, while the industrial Haber-Bosch process is energy intensive and requires high temperatures and pressures. %Understanding this reaction mechanism will give new insights into ways of splitting dinitrogen and may lead to better catalysts and processes for fertilizer production.
To elucidate how FeMoco achieves this feat one needs to accurately calculate the energy for many configurations of the molecule 
%(shown in Figure \ref{fig:femoco}) 
along candidate reaction pathways. While most of the protein
% (left part of the figure) 
can be simulated using approximate methods on classical supercomputers, accurate calculation of the active center of FeMoco,
%(shown on the right), 
containing iron and molybdenum atoms, %. The correlated nature of electrons in this complex 
so far defies classical methods, but will be feasible using a quantum computer as a co-processor.
 %to calculate accurate energies for this part of the protein, 
%will be able augment classical simulations and shed light on this problem. 
Given the relevance of catalytic processes in the chemical industry, quantum computers may find many commercially relevant applications in this area.

Similar algorithms have been developed for the simulation of crystalline materials, where approximate classical 
%electronic structure 
methods 
%based on standard density functional theory 
can be augmented by quantum computations
% of the correlated conduction bands of transition metal atoms 
to understand and design novel materials with exotic properties. These may include higher temperature superconductors, novel functional materials with switchable properties and non-toxic dyes. 
%While it may seem tempting to simulate all electrons of a material on a quantum computer, hybrid methods that solve as much as possible using classical computers have much more economical resource requirements.  


\section{Quantum accelerated classical applications}
The power of quantum mechanics can also be applied to solving purely classical computational problems by making use of quantum superposition and entanglement. Here we present a selection of likely and potential applications, based on the quantum algorithms in Box \ref{sec:box2}.

\subsection{Cryptography}
Shor's algorithm \cite{Shor1994} for integer factorization was the first demonstration that quantum computers could be used to solve hard computational problems outside the realm of quantum physics and raised interest in this, up to that time, esoteric approach to computing. Integer factorization falls more broadly within a class of problems called the Hidden Subgroup Problems (HSPs).  Polynomial-time quantum algorithms exist not only for breaking RSA, but also for breaking Diffie-Hellman, DSA, Buchmann-Williams, and others, thus posing a threat and challenge to many common public-key encryption schemes.

\subsection{Search}


Another famous example of a quantum algorithm outperforming classical ones is Grover's algorithm \cite{Grover1996} for searching the index of an item in an unsorted collection. While classically $O(N)$ queries are needed, a quantum computer can solve this problem with just $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. Applications are finding minimal (optimal) values,  determining graph connectivity, and pattern matching.

However, query complexity alone may be misleading. %To establish quantum advantage for an application one has to take into account the cost of implementing the queries.
 Indeed, for naive database lookup, each quantum query has to access the complete database, with $O(N)$ complexity, thus raising the full cost to $O(N^{3/2})$ and bringing it to be worse than the classical complexity $O(N)$. Applications of Grover's algorithms will thus be {\rm implicit} searches, where the value at a given index can be calculated efficiently \cite{MarkovGrover}. 

\subsection{Linear systems}

Similar considerations apply to the linear systems algorithm \cite{HHL}, which allows  sampling from solutions $\mathbf{x}$ of a well-conditioned  linear system of equations $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ with exponential speedup over classical algorithms -- as long as the operation $e^{-iAt}$ can be efficiently implemented using quantum gates. For arbitrary $N\times N$ matrices this requires at least $O(N^2)$ effort, which undoes any advantage of the quantum algorithm. %In addition, the algorithm only allows sampling from the solution, since reading out all the elements of $\mathbf{x}$ would take time $O(N)$ and thus again counter the speedup obtained.
Practical applications of the algorithm thus require matrices $A$ that can be described algorithmically. %and the computation of only $O(\log N)$ bits of information from the solution  $\mathbf{x}$. 
Such problems include  finite difference and finite element discretization of partial differential equations, where one can determine, for example, solutions to electromagnetic scattering problems on exponentially fine meshes. 

\subsection{Sampling}

Statistical sampling using Monte Carlo methods plays an important role in many application areas, including the wide field of machine learning. Quantum computers offer two possibilities for quadratic speedup in these applications. 

To accelerate sampling one prepares qubits in a superposition corresponding to the desired distribution. Naive readout of the qubits  samples from that superposition with the error on the sample mean decreasing as $1/\sqrt{M}$ with the number of samples $M$. %Employing %interferometric methods on 
A quantum computer can achieve errors that decrease quadratically faster, as $1/M$, by making use of the a quantum analog of the Fourier sampling theorem.

Quantum computers can also obtain a quadratic speedup in the mixing times of Markov chains when implementing them as quantum walks. This finds applications, for example, in stochastic optimization methods like simulated annealing \cite{qsa}, where  a quadratic acceleration is highly desired for hard optimization problems. 

\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/coarse_toolchain}
\caption{The proposed toolchain for quantum programming \cite{stack}: The quantum program is implemented in an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) and then translated to hardware instructions using a series of compilers, which generate quantum intermediate representations (QIR) of the code. Pre-compiled libraries are linked against prior to creating the logical layout and applying error correction, since this will produce more efficient code. The resulting low-level quantum intermediate representation (LLQIR) is then mapped to hardware.}
\label{fig:toolchain}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Privacy}

In an age of increasing awareness of privacy the broadest impact may not even come from quantum algorithms outperforming their classical counterparts but in  privacy for computing. Indeed, blind quantum computing \cite{blind} allows the user of a quantum computer to run quantum algorithms without the operator of the  quantum computer being able to detect what is being computed. Provable privacy and security of cloud computing may be more important for many users than accelerating calculations with quantum speedup. On the contrary, in many settings one may even be willing to take a performance hit in return for perfect security. One may speculate that this could ultimately be one of the biggest applications for quantum computers.

 
\section{Software architecture}


Until recently there has been a separation between quantum algorithm theory and experiment, with theory focused on mathematical proofs of algorithmic improvements and experiment focused on controlling qubit lifetimes.  In turn, quantum computations have thus far been mostly described at the level of mathematics and logic gate operations (see Box \ref{sec:box1}), compiled and manually optimized for a small quantum device or simulator.  While some quantum programming languages and compilers exist, a complete software architecture remains to be developed.
As hardware steadily advances past single-qubit devices towards 100-qubit devices and beyond, a challenge is presented for computer scientists, engineers, and developers to design and architect a software framework for programming and controlling a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computer.

 
High-level programming languages and optimizing compilers are designed to provide layers of abstraction of the computation, therefore creating a simple, modular programming environment. The development of software in advance of a fully scalable hardware architecture allows the verification and analysis of software components and rapid innovation in algorithm design.
The idea dates back to FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation),
% one of the oldest programming languages and compilers.  FORTRAN 
 which was created to transition users from mathematical formulas and machine code into algorithm design and specification.  FORTRAN's simplicity allowed more rapid programming and execution, improving programming speed by $500\%$ and reducing the length of programs.% by over $20\%$.

Quantum computing requires a similar software revolution, as the algorithms and hardware are complex systems.
%A computer grounded in quantum mechanical principles carries with it a unique set of computational attributes, such as superposition, entanglement, and no cloning to name a few.  
Novel constructs for programming, optimizing, and controlling quantum hardware are necessary to fully harness and manipulate quantum states for algorithmic advantage. Debugging tools will require innovative approaches due to the entanglement of qubits and the inability to copy.  In this regard, simulators and emulators will be critical for the design and testing of quantum algorithms and circuits. Early design decisions can result in substantial cost savings on the path to finalizing an end-to-end system, and enable the verification, analysis, and redesign of key components of the system.

%The significant steps of any quantum computing design flow \cite{svore2006layered} include a front end, a technology-independent optimizer, a technology-dependent %optimizer, and a technology simulator or quantum device.  The interfaces between the steps require a high-level programming language and several intermediate and low-%level representations.


Figure \ref{fig:toolchain} shows a software stack for quantum computing \cite{stack},
%The stack should enhance communication between algorithm designers, quantum engineers, and experimental physicists alike.
which should provide well-defined interfaces between the software and hardware systems and should enable programming of any quantum algorithm of any size for any target architecture.

At the top is a high-level language in which one writes quantum programs.
%The high-level quantum programming language may be one of several~\cite{gay2006quantum}:
%some are based on C \cite{omer1998procedural} and others based on functional languages \cite{green13,wecker14}.
Since quantum programs consist of an intimate mixture of classical and quantum instructions, a compelling case can be made for an embedded domain-specific language such as Quipper \cite{green13} or LIQ$Ui\ket{} $\cite{wecker14} in order to maximally leverage classical language and compilation features.
%Both are functional languages, the former is embedded in Haskell and allows extensible data types and advanced programming constructs,
%while the latter contains a domain-specific language embedded in F\#.
%In contrast to Quipper,  LIQ$Ui\ket{} $ also features simulators for noise and resource analysis, but neither allows for hardware backends.

To ensure flexibility and modularity, the high-level compilers are hardware agnostic and, combined with quantum meta functions, e.g., conditional instructions and user annotations, enable a very high level of optimization of quantum code.  
The low-level compilers of the stack will allow automatic translations to hardware instructions for specific backend quantum devices.  

The development of standard libraries for quantum subroutines, including those for arithmetic operations and complex quantum subroutines, will speed up the development of new quantum programs.
Auto-tuning of these quantum libraries allows determination of the best representations for a given target backend and in turn can result in substantial cost savings in the final implementation of the quantum algorithms on any hardware \cite{stack}.  Building high-level quantum applications on libraries will let them take advantage of algorithmic improvements in those components, just as in classical applications. Recent examples of such optimizations in the quantum domain include substantial complexity reductions in simulating quantum chemical systems and savings of several orders of magnitude in quantum gate synthesis.

The bottom of the stack  supports a variety of backends, including simulators, emulators, resource analyzers, or any proposed quantum hardware implementation.
%Ultimately the software stack needs to be designed to program and automate the control of a quantum computer, no matter the size of the algorithm or device.
While the upper layers of the stack are agnostic to whether the hardware backend is an ion trap, superconducting system, quantum dot, or topological quantum computer, the lower layers allow tuning and optimization of control for the specific device design, including layout, scheduling, and control optimization.

%Later work presents a more detailed software architecture \cite{jones2012layered}, however the components are specific to a quantum dot architecture and the focus is %mainly on the pipelined control cycle from the application layer down to the physical hardware layer.


%A grand challenge for computer scientists and engineers will be to design the components of the quantum stack, such that the task of implementing a quantum algorithm and optimizing it becomes streamlined and efficient. 
%The design will require leveraging the advances in the classical space, while also developing novel solutions for the quantum domain.



\section{Conclusions and Outlook}

Experimental progress in the development of qubits has developed to the point where scalable qubit technology exists. Within the next couple of years we may expect to see the development of small quantum computers with more than one hundred physical qubits. This will enable early applications using short quantum algorithms that do not exceed the lifetime of these qubits and may provide the first demonstration of quantum computers outperforming classical ones on certain problems.

More importantly, it will pave the way towards development of logical qubits using quantum error correction, and engineering efforts to scale to bigger robust quantum computers. In parallel to these hardware developments the necessary software is being designed and implemented. Quantum software efforts need to match the hardware developments and encompass the whole stack from low-level control of qubits to high-level applications.

 Quantum algorithms for quantum simulations and factoring have been optimized to the point where they can be viewed as realistic applications on small to medium scale quantum computers. For other applications, including linear systems, sampling, and machine learning, algorithmic optimizations and in-depth resource estimates are still required. 

While quantum algorithms are generally much less well understood than their classical cousins, the search continues for which important problems can be solved much faster on quantum computers and which cannot. Answering this question has become increasingly important, and industrial efforts are emerging that focus on the impending quantum revolution.

\section{Quantum bits and quantum gates}
\label{sec:box1}
While a classical bit $x$ can take only one of the two values $x=0$ or $x=1$, a quantum bit $q$ can be in a superposition
\begin{equation}
|q\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle +\beta|1\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two complex numbers, normalized such that
$|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$. Identifying the two classical states 0 and 1 with two-dimensional complex valued vectors 
 \begin{equation}
 |0\rangle = \left(\begin{array}{c}1\\0\end{array}\right) \qquad {\rm and} \qquad  |1\rangle = \left(\begin{array}{c}0\\1\end{array}\right)
 \end{equation}
  the state of the qubit can be described by the vector 
  \begin{equation}
  |q\rangle = \left(\begin{array}{c}\alpha\\\beta\end{array}\right),
  \end{equation} which is also called the wave function of the qubit. Generalizing to a qubit register $| \mathbf{x}\rangle=|x_0\ldots x_{N-1}\rangle$ consisting of $N$ individual qubits, a $2^N$ dimensional complex vector of coefficients $c_i$ is needed to describe all possible superpositions
  \begin{equation}
  |\mathbf{x}\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{2^N-1} c_i |\mathbf{i}\rangle,
  \end{equation}
where the $k$-th bit of the integer $i$ corresponds to the values of the $k$-th qubit.

The exponential memory required to represent the state of just $N$ qubits hints at the potential for exponentially larger computational power of quantum computers compared to classical ones. Current high end supercomputers are barely able to represent the state of $N\approx50$ qubits. %and simulating $N=60$ qubits is beyond the powers of planned exa-scale machines. 
Already small-scale quantum computers with about one hundred qubits offer computational capabilities that go beyond that of any classical computer for certain applications.


Despite requiring $2^N$ complex numbers to represent a quantum state on a classical computers, when reading out a quantum register one obtains just $N$ bits of information. Of all the $2^N$ classical values in the superposition one value $i$ is chosen at random in a measurement, according to a probability distribution given by the squares of the wave function entries $|c_i|^2$.

\end{figure*}



\section{Quantum algorithms}
\label{sec:box2}
The superiority of quantum computers over classical ones is due to the existence of quantum algorithms that solve a range of problems  better than the best-known classical algorithms \cite{jordan2011quantum}. Below we list a selection of these algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Grover search}:
Searching a database of unstructured items is a key problem in computer science.  Given the ability to evaluate a function $f: \{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$, the task is to find $x$ such that $f(x)=1$.  If such an $x$ does not exist, then return that no such item exists.   
Grover's algorithm solves the unstructured search problem on a quantum computer with only $O(\sqrt{N})$ evaluations of $f$ in the worst case, while classically $O(N)$ evaluations are required.  

\item {\bf Period finding}: Given a periodic function $f(x)=f(x+r)$ find the period $r$. Classically this requires $O(r)$ function evaluations. Quantumly, using Shor's period finding algorithm that is at the root of his factoring algorithm, the same problem can be solved in time polymial in the number of bits to represent the function values and arguments, which can be exponentially smaller than $r$.

\item {\bf Linear systems}: Given an $N\times N$ matrix $A$ and a $N$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{b}$, find $\mathbf{x}$ such that $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$.
Classically, it requires time polynomial in $N$ using methods like Gaussian elimination or iterative solvers. Quantumly, for well-conditioned matrices whose condition number $\kappa$ grows at most polylogarithmically in $N$ it requires time polynomial in $\log N$ to sample from the solution \cite{HHL}. 


\item  {\bf  Sampling from a distribution}: Classically the number of samples $N$ needed to estimate the mean of a random variable with error $\epsilon$  scales as $N\sim \epsilon^{-2}$. Quantumly, if a wave function can be prepared to represent the distributions then the expected value can be measured with an effort  $\sim\epsilon^{-1}$ that is quadratically smaller.

\item       {\bf Quantum walks}:
A walk, or random walk, is a succession of random steps on a given graph. Quantum walks, the quantum generalization of classical random walks, produce a quantum superposition whose probability distribution corresponds to that of a classical random walk. They can spread significantly faster than classical random walks and thus reduce hitting times and mixing times in walk-based algorithms.


\item   {\bf Quantum tunneling}: Escaping from local minima is an important problem in heuristic optimization algorithms. Quantum systems can ``tunnel'' between local minima faster than classical local search algorithms can climb the barrier separating them, if the barrier is tall but narrow. It is currently unknown whether this can lead to faster solutions for hard optimization problems of practical interest.

\item   {\bf Quantum simulation}: Being discrete quantum devices, quantum computers are by construction well suited for simulating discrete quantum systems, such as electrons in molecular orbitals or in a crystal lattice, %Given a potentially time-dependent Hamiltonian ({\it i.e.} energy function) $H(t)$ that describes a system and the initial state of system $\ket{\psi(0)}$, the task is to determine a given property of the state after evolving according to Schr\"odinger's equation, which can be discretized as  $\ket{\psi(t+\delta_t)}=e^{-iH(t)\delta_t}\ket{\psi(t)}$. 
%Using time evolution a quantum computer can efficiently  
and calculate many important properties: one can prepare ground states and excited states, measure their energies by mimicking interferometry and the outcome of any measurement procedure by simulating experimental procedures.


\end{itemize}

\section{Quantum algorithms from a classical point of view}
\label{sec:box3}


The advantage of quantum computers over classical ones is sometimes over-simplified to be due to the former being able to perform computations on all possible inputs simultaneously. More accurately, many quantum algorithms can be viewed as instances of the design pattern shown in Figure \ref{fig:simd}. At a high level such a quantum program can be viewed to be similar to MapReduce, but acting on all possible values on a {\em single} quantum CPU. After a quantum superposition of all input values is prepared, a computation is performed simultaneously on all values, before summary information is computed in a reduction step and read out. 

While conceptually similar to MapReduce there are a number of important differences that show both the powers and limitations of quantum computers. Performing operations on a superposition of exponentially many input values, a quantum computer can be viewed as an extreme form of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) processor. While exponentially more powerful than a classical computer, the SIMD analogy also points out some of the challenges: conditional instructions have to implemented using masking registers (called control qubits), both branches of an if-else statement have to be executed and any loops have to be iterated for the worst case.

Quantum gates being unitary operations are by definition reversible. This requires that any classical function that a quantum computer computer should perform is first converted to a reversible classical function, which can potentially incur large overheads in memory (for ancilla registers) and runtime.

Naively the next step might be thought to be the readout of the results. However, recall (see Box \ref{sec:box1}) that when reading out an $N$-qubit quantum register one only obtains $N$ classical bits of information and one of the computational states making up the superposition is chosen at random. If the computation has applied a classical function to a superposition of inputs then this is  equivalent to reading out the function value for a random input, which defeats the purpose of performing calculations in a superposition. 

To profit from quantum parallelism a quantum algorithm thus has to perform a global reduction function to all the qubits before reading out the quantum registers in a measurement. Such reduction operations include quantum Fourier transforms, used in Shor's period finding algorithm, or amplitude amplification used in Grover's search. Growing the limited selection of such operations is one of the challenges in designing new quantum algorithms.

% simpler here.)

% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.
